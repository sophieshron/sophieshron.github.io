      <div class= "title">HELLO FRIENDS,</div>
      <div class= "intro body-text">

As of February 2nd 2012 another establishment is being built where our store stands and we regret to inform you that we have decided to shut down forever. Initially we attempted to move within the Forest Hills area but we could not find something both affordable and adequate. We take that as a sign that the times are changing and so should we. After carefully weighing our options we decided to gracefully bow out rather than relocate the store during tough economic times and risk not being able to provide the same level of service that you've come to expect from us. This was an extremely hard decision for us and in many ways it's the end of an era. This store is all we've ever known. <br><br>

It's no secret that economic times are rough and small family owned/operated businesses are disappearing. We have been here since 1963 but the shop itself has been in business for at least 75 years. It was not an easy decision to close up a shop which has been in the same building for nearly a century, believe me! After serving you all for over 50 years, we feel it's best to end the store on a high note and move on to different things.<br><br>

We hope that our roses/ribbons/advice/conversations/etc. helped you cope during the saddest times of your life such as funerals and illness and we hope that we made you happy during the best times of your life such as weddings, newborn babies and proms.<br><br>

Thank you for making us a part of your lives and if you'd like to keep in touch you can write us an E-Mail at store@sister-unns.com or you can send a handwritten letter to the shop's former address: 72-32 Austin st. Forest Hills NY, 11375. The U.S. Postal Service will forward your letter to us.<br><br>

Thanks for the memories.<br><br>
- The entire Sister Unn's family<br><br>
