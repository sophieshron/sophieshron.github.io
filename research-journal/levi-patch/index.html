    <div class="title">LEVI <br>STRAUSS <br> </div>
    <div class="info"> One of the better known and oldest logos used in fashion is the Levi Strauss & Co. logo. The logo was designed in 1892 and is still used on the iconic leather patches for the blue jeans today. The logo features an ornate design with text as well as illustrations, so that even those who could not read will understand the logo and recognize the brand’s integrity. The company name spans the top of the logo, along with phrases such as “ORIGINAL RIVETED”, “QUALITY CLOTHING”, and “PATENTED MAY 20 1873”. The illustrations on the logo show two men with horses, facing opposite directions, pulling a pair of blue jeans apart, to signify the durable quality of the blue jeans. The infamous blue jean brand is an American brand founded by Levi Strauss. When he moved to San Francisco, he built wagons, and other Western horse supplies. It was not until the California Gold Rush when he began crafting blue jeans, a type of pants made from denim. The pants were built for work and needed to be movable, but also heavy-duty and durable. Jacob Davis, a tailor from Reno, Nevada approached Strauss when a number of his customers kept coming to him with blue jeans ripping at the seams. The two collaborated to create the first copper rivet, the small metal bolts that reinforce blue jeans at the pockets and seams. In 1873, Levi Strauss & Co. received their first patent for copper riveted blue jeans, hence the statement of “ORIGINAL RIVETED” being featured on the logo. The original Levi Strauss & Co. logo is a signifier of a brand’s integrity, and of quality assurance. The logo ensures durability, and a pair of blue jeans that is built to last. The logo is also a stamp of approval. <br><br> Since Levi Strauss had received a patent for the use of copper rivets, the logo lets the buyer know that this is the best pair of jeans and there is not another one out there that compares. From a buyer’s standpoint in the late 19th century, they will likely only want to purchase one pair of jeans that can be worn everyday without ripping or tearing. When a buyer sees that Levi’s logo, they know it ensures quality and that it is a brand they can trust.
