    <div class="title">RED <br> TAB</div>
    <div class="info"> Although the original Levi Stauss logo from 1873 was designed for brand integrity, the introduction of the “Red Tab” on the inside lip of the back pocket introduced an additional element of brand recognition and brand status. The infamous red tab was added in 1936 as a signifier of authenticity for the brand.  The small red tab stood out boldly in contrast to the blue jeans and it somehow became a tiny signifier of some of the most coveted jeans on the market. In the 1970’s and 1980’s, blue jeans were being worn by teens and young people. The traditional workwear pant was becoming less about Western America and more about cool, rebellious teen fashion. A provocative Levi Strauss commercial from 1985 dubbed the “Laundrette” advertisement shows teen heartthrob, Nick Kamen stripping down to his boxers at a laundromat. The camera pans to the rear of his jeans to display the tiny, but ever so important red tab.  In an interview conducted with Kara Staunton, who grew up in the 1980’s, she recalls the importance of the red tab as not only a brand signifier, but a status symbol from being a teenager in the 1980’s. “I remember after that commercial came out, everyone was wearing Levi jeans, but if they didn’t have the little red tag, it meant nothing. The red tag was easily recognizable and it was a symbol of if you were cool or if you were ‘uncool’. Everyone was wearing them. Danny in Greece, Baby in Dirty Dancing, all the iconic movies, and that translated into teen fashion in the 80’s. If you didn’t have the red tag on your Levi’s, what was the point?” <br><br>

What started as a durable blue jean brand built for California gourmet miners, transitioned into something that represented rebellious teen fashion, and now classic American leisure. The logo and red tab that was once intended to signify quality assurance and authenticity has now become a symbol of status, or a mark that stood for admittance into some sort of exclusive social group.
